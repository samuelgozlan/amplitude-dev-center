title: Databricks Import
---

Amplitude's Databricks import source enables you to import data from Databricks to your Amplitude account. Databricks import uses the [Databricks Change Data Feed](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html#use-delta-lake-change-data-feed-on-databricks) feature to securely access and extract live data from your Databricks workspace.

!!! beta
    This feature is in Beta. Amplitude may make changes to this feature without prior notification. For help, contact [Amplitude Support](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). 

## Features

- Import all data types, including events, user properties, and group properties.
- Support for delta sync, to ensure Amplitude imports only new or changed data.
  - For **event** data, Amplitude imports rows with an `insert` operation.
  - For **user properties** and **group properties**, Amplitude imports rows with `insert` or `update` operations.
  - Amplitude ignores rows with `delete` operations for all data types.
- Create joins to import data from multiple tables.

## Limitations

- User Look-Up page won't be able to display most recent 100 events ingested through this feature yet

For guided instructions to setting up this integration, view the [Loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/a00f8905170e4c83977ae6fb2f0dcde7?sid=5a77e8c9-d34b-42b0-a179-679669c8bdbe).

## Configure Databricks

Before you start to configure the Databricks source in Amplitude, complete the following tasks in Databricks.

### Find or create an all-purpose compute cluster

Amplitude creates workflows in this cluster on your behalf to start sync jobs. When complete, copy the **Server hostname** and **Http path** values to use in a later step. Find both values on the **Configuration -> JDBC/ODBC** tab. For more information about cluster types, see [Compute](https://docs.databricks.com/en/compute/index.html).

Ensure that the new cluster can run jobs by NOT having configs below in cluster's policy. See details in Databricks' article [Policy definition](https://docs.databricks.com/en/administration-guide/clusters/policy-definition.html#workload).

```json
"workload_type.clients.jobs": {
    "type": "fixed",
    "value": false
}
```

### Authentication

Amplitude's Databricks import supports authentication with [personal access tokens for Databricks workspace users](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#pat-user), or [personal access tokens for Service Principals](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#pat-sp). Choose Workspace User authentication for faster setup, or Service Principal authentication for finer grained control. For more information, see Databrick's article [Authentication for Databricks Automation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/index.html#authentication-for-databricks-automation---overview)

#### Get a personal access token (PAT) for the workspace user

Amplitude's Databricks import uses Personal Access Tokens to authenticate. For the quickest setup, create a PAT for your workspace user in Databricks. For more information, see Databricks' article [Personal Access Tokens for Workspace Users](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-workspace-users)

#### Create a personal access token (PAT) service principal (optional)

Amplitude recommends that you create a [service principal](https://docs.databricks.com/en/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html) in Databricks to allow for more granular control of access.

1. Follow the Databricks instructions to create a service principal in [Databricks | OAuth machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/oauth-m2m.html). Copy the **UUID** for use in a later step.
2. Generate a PAT on this Service Principal.
    
    - If you use AWS or GCP Databricks, follow the instructions in the article [Databricks personal access tokens for service principals](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/auth/pat.html#databricks-personal-access-tokens-for-service-principals).
    - If you use Azure-based Databricks, follow the instructions in the article [Manage personal access tokens for a service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals#manage-personal-access-tokens-for-a-service-principal).

The service principal you created above requires the following permissions in Databricks:

| Permission | Reason                                                                               | Location in Databricks                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workspace  | Grants access to your Databricks workspace.                                          | *Workspace → <workspace_name> → Permissions → Add permissions* <br/> Add the service principal you create with the User permission, click Save. |
| Table      | Grants access to list tables and read data.                                          | *Catalog → pick the catalog→ Permissions → Grant* <br/> Select the `Data Reader` permission (`USE CATALOG`, `USE SCHEMA`, `EXECUTE`, `READ VOLUME`, `SELECT`).             |
| Cluster    | Grants access to connect to the cluster and run workflows on your behalf             | *Compute → All-purpose compute → Edit Permission*  <br/> Add the `Add Can Attach To` permission to the service principal.            |
| Export     | Enables the service principal to unload your data through spark and export it to S3. | Run the SQL commands below in any notebook.                                    |

```sql title="Databricks Export permission commands"
GRANT MODIFY ON ANY FILE TO `<service_principal_uuid>`;
GRANT SELECT ON ANY FILE TO `<service_principal_uuid>`;
```

### Enable CDF on your table(s)

Amplitude uses Databricks' Change Data Feed to continuously import data. To enable CDF on a Databricks table, see [Databricks | Enable change data feed](https://docs.databricks.com/en/delta/delta-change-data-feed.html#enable-change-data-feed)

## Configure the Amplitude Databricks source

To add Databricks as a source in Amplitude, complete the following steps.

### Connect to Databricks

1. In Amplitude Data, click **Catalog** and navigate to the **Sources** tab.
2. Search for **Databricks**.
3. On the **Credentials** tab of the Connect Databricks screen, enter the credentials you configured during the Databricks configuration:
    - Server Hostname
    - HTTP Path
    - Personal Access Token (for the workspace user or Service Principal)
4. Click **Next** to verify access.

### Select data to import

1. Select the Databricks table(s) from which Amplitude pulls data.
2. Select the version of the table(s) that Amplitude imports from. Select **First** or **Latest**.
3. Select the data type to import from the selected table(s). The Databricks source supports three data types.
    - Event
    - User properties
    - Group properties
    
    For the **Event** data type, optionally select **Sync User Properties** or **Sync Group Properties** to sync the selected data types *within* an event.

4. Set the sync frequency. This frequency determines the interval at which Amplitude pulls data from Databricks.
5. Configure the SQL command that transforms data in Databricks before Amplitude imports it.
    - Amplitude treats each record in the SQL execution as an event to be import. See the Example body in the [Batch Event Upload API](/analytics/apis/batch-event-upload-api/#example-body) documentation to ensure each record you import complies.
    - Amplitude can transform / import from only the tables you specify in step 1 above.
    - The table names you reference in the SQL command must match exactly the name of the table you select in step 1. For example, if you select `catalog.schema.table1`, use that exact value in the SQL.

    ```sql title="Sample SQL command"
    select 
        unix_millis(current_timestamp())                                       as time,
        id                                                                     as user_id,
        "demo"                                                                 as event_type,
        named_struct('name', name, 'home', home, 'age', age, 'income', income) as user_properties,
        named_struct('group_type1', ARRAY("group_A", "group_B"))               as groups,
        named_struct('group_property', "group_property_value")                 as group_properties
    from catalog.schema.table1;
    ```

6. After you add the SQL, click **Test SQL**. Amplitude runs a test against your Databricks instance to ensure the SQL is valid. Click **Next**.
7. Enter a descriptive name for this instance of the source.
8. The source appears in your workspace's Sources list.

## Verify data import

Events that Amplitude imports assume the name you assign in your SQL statement. In the example above, the events have the name `demo`

To verify the data coming into Amplitude:

- Navigate to the **Performance** tab of the source instance
- View the Events page of your Tracking Plan
- Create a Segmentation chart that filters on the event name you specify.
